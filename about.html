            <p class="animate-on-scroll">Women in Entrepreneurship (WE) at UW–Madison is a bold, inclusive community redefining what it means to be a student entrepreneur. We exist to empower women—across all disciplines, backgrounds, and experience levels—to not only explore entrepreneurship, but to lead, build, and launch ventures that create real-world change.</p>
            <p class="animate-on-scroll">WE is more than a network — it's a catalyst. Through hands-on experience, team-building, mentorship, industry connections, and leadership development, we equip our members with the tools and confidence to turn ideas into impact. From skill-building workshops and speaker panels to project incubation and pitch showcases, WE supports every step of the entrepreneurial journey.</p>
            <p class="animate-on-scroll">Whether you're just curious about innovation or ready to bring a venture to life, WE is where you'll find the people, the platform, and the power to grow. Our mission is to cultivate a generation of women who are not just participants in the entrepreneurial world — but the most fearless, future-shaping leaders.</p>
